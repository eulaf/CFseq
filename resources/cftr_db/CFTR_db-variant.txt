Although this sequence variant has not been previously reported in a patient, the functional role of the V97A amino acid substitution has been studied experimentally in an overexpression system.  In that system, CFTR containing V97A was found to have some properties that differ from the WT protein, and other properties that were essentially identical to those of the WT protein.  Overall, the clinical significance of the V97A variant cannot be predicted.

When in cis with 5T and in trans to an additional severe CFTR mutation, mild to severe pancreatic sufficient or insufficient CF can be expected.  However, when in cis to 7T or 9T, mild and indolent forms of CF are more typical.  References:  Massie et al., Eur Respir J 2001."

However, the 5T/7T/9T variant in intron 8 can influence the severity of the R117H. It can be a disease-causing allele (R117H in cis with 5T) or demonstrate no symptoms to mild manifestations in the CF spectrum (R117H in cis with 7T or 9T). Homozygous R117H was reported in a CBAVD patient. G542X/R117H (in cis with 5T) was reported in three pancreatic sufficient CF patients.

A one year old male of Hispanic-African American descent presenting with chronic respiratory problems was reported to carry both I285F and a synonymous change at alanine 455. I285F has also been observed in the parent of a CF patient; in that family, the proband did not carry I285F, but had two severe CF mutations that accounted for her disease.  Overall, because of the limited knowledge of this missense change, the exact clinical significance is unknown.

While this mutation has primarily been reported in association with mild CF and CBAVD, recent studies suggest that this mutation may result in severe CF symptoms when present as part of a complex allele in cis with another mild CF mutation.

Two additional patients, one with failure to thrive and another with clinical suspicion of CF, also had this sequence change. However, the complete genotypes and further clinical information for these patients was not available. This change was detected in 2 of 46 normal chromosomes (4.3%) in a Hispanic population. As such, the clinical significance of this sequence change is unknown, and it may be benign.

It is a single base pair substitution which results in the replacement of a glycine with serine at codon 551. Homozygous G551S was described in two pancreatic sufficient sisters with mild CF and normal sweat chloride levels. A subsequent report described three Mexican siblings with mild CF who were all compound heterozygous for delF508 and G551S. A different mutation at this same amino acid position, G551D has also been described and is one of the most common CFTR mutations in the U.S. population.

The mutant protein traffics to the apical membrane, but chloride channel function is markedly reduced (class III mutation). Compared to CF patients homozygous for the delF508 mutation, patients with the G551D mutation have a milder CF phenotype with a lower incidence of meconium ileus and later pancreatic insufficiency.

A single patient with severe CF symptoms carried this variant on the same allele as G1244V and also carried G542X on the other allele. The remaining individuals carrying only this variant were asymptomatic, including a 46 year-old female with two CF affected siblings.  Experimental and clinical data suggest that in isolation this change is a neutral variant but it may significantly impair CFTR function when inherited in cis with another CFTR mutation.

Most recently, in a series of four compound heterozygotes for L997F and a second pathogenic variant, three were asymptomatic and the fourth had mild atypical cystic fibrosis. Therefore, overall, the clinical significance of L997F is currently unknown.

It was initially described in a male with CBAVD who carried delF508 on the other allele. This missense mutation destroys a TaqI restriction endonuclease site and has been reported as part of a complex allele with the R74W sequence change; importantly, R74W may cause more severe CFTR dysfunction when found in cis with D1270N.   D1270N has also been described in two patients of African origin with mild CF. Overall, the clinical significance of D1270N is still poorly understood and somewhat controversial.

It was initially described in a French patient with idiopathic pancreatitis and later described in an African patient with pancreatic insufficiency and elevated sweat chloride levels. This change occurs two nucleotides downstream of the CFTR termination stop codon and was speculated to affect splicing, polyadenylation, and/or mRNA stability. Overall, the clinical significance of this sequence change is unclear.  References: Audrezet et al., Eur J Hum Genet 2002; Mutesa et al.
